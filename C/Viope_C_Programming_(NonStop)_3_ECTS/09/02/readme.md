The file "numbers.s" contains 4 integers. The numbers are on the first line of the file, separated by spaces. Write a program that reads the integers from the file and calculates their sum. Finally, the program prints the numbers and the sum on the screen.

Example output:
```c
Numbers found in the file numbers.s:
93, 432, 65 and 22

Sum of the numbers: 612
```
The verification of program output does not account for whitespace characters like "\n", "\t" and " "
